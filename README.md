<h2>1. Installations</h2><br>
pandas<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
numpy<br>
scipy<br>

<h2>2. Project Motivation</h2><br>
Investigation of data from EPA for gasoline vehicles in the US from 1984 until 2017. During the investigation the below questions are searched for answers<br>

- How did the engine evolve?<br>
- Is Turbocharging Good for C02 Emissions?<br>
- What Is The Effect Of Transmission Type on C02 Emissions?<br>

<h2>3. File Descriptions</h2><br>
Data_analysis.ipynb : Code and analysis file<br>
database.csv : EPA vehicle data from 1984 until 2017<br>
/plots : folder where the plots obtained from the analysis and the green car picture used in the blog is stored<br>

<h2>4. How to Interact with your project</h2><br>
The code and the database.csv needs to be in the same folder. The code in Data_analysis.ipynb can be ran directly without any modification.
